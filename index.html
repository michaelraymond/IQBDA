          <h2>What is IQBDA?</h2>
          IQBDA is a society of professional QBASIC (nee
          Quick Basic) programmers from around the world.
          Members of the society benefit from the direct
          exchange of information gained at IQBDA workshops
          and conferences.
          
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        
        <p>
          IQBDA is committed to the continued support of
          QBASIC from Microsoft, the vendor. Our members
          worked hard to develop their QBASIC expertise and
          believe that QBASIC is still a viable platform for
          business software solutions.
        </p>
